Download the Code- Click the following link to download all the code for this codelab:

Download source code- Unpack the downloaded zip file. This will unpack a root folder (your-first-pwapp-master), which contains one folder for each step of this codelab, along with all of the resources you will need.

The step-NN folders contain the desired end state of each step of this codelab. They are there for reference. We’ll be doing all our coding work in a directory called work.
Install and verify web server- While you’re free to use your own web server, this codelab is designed to work well with the Chrome Web Server. If you don't have that app installed yet, you can install it from the Chrome Web Store.

Install Web Server for Chrome- After installing the Web Server for Chrome app, click on the Apps shortcut on the bookmarks bar:
In the ensuing window, click on the Web Server icon:
You’ll see this dialog next, which allows you to configure your local web server. Click the choose folder button, and select the work folder. This will enable you to serve your work in progress via the URL highlighted in the web server dialog (in the Web Server URL(s) section).

Under Options, check the box next to “Automatically show index.html”, as shown below:
Then stop and restart the server by sliding the toggle labeled “Web Server: STARTED” to the left and then back to the right. Now visit your work site in your web browser (by clicking on the highlighted Web Server URL) and you should see a page that looks like this.

This app is not yet doing anything interesting - so far, it's just a minimal skeleton with a spinner we're using to verify your web server functionality. We'll add functionality and UI features in subsequent steps.
