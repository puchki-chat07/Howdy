## Tutorial 1: Proofread the Getting Started topic 

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to your home folder from Users > folder with your user name.
3. Create a folder on your local machine.
4. Clone the repo into the folder you just created.
    - Run `git clone git@github.com:puchki-chat07/Howdy.git` to clone the repo. Learn more about the [`git clone` command] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository). More details [here] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16427600/how-git-clone-actually-works) on "behind-the-scene-effect" of the git clone command.
    - You can copy the clone command from GitHub. See this [screenshot] (https://thoughtspot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TC/pages/323977243/Create+a+repository+clone+on+your+local+machine?preview=/323977243/323878920/image2018-6-4_17-24-24.png).
5. Navigate to the `getstarted.md` file.
6. Create a branch on that folder to be able to make changes to the files (and files in subfolders).
    - To create a new branch and switch to the branch at the same time, run the git checkout -b `<branch_name>`. Learn more about [git checkout] (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout) command.
7. Run `git branch` to verify that you are on the branch you just created.
7. Git status.
8. Git push origin <branch_name> to create a remote copy of your branch on GitHub.
9. Proofedit and structure the content following the Technical Writing best practices. See MSTP for reference. 
10. Git add .
11. Git `commit -a`.  
  - Add the details of the changes made and are ready to committed
12. Run git push origin <branch_name>
13. Go to Github and compare and create a pull request
14. Verify both the origin and branch that you want to merge. This merges your fork to master.
15. Add comment.
16. Merge pull
